# Playlist

This module is used to create new playlists or update existing ones.

It needs the main `venv` active.

- copy `_blueprint.py` into a new file in this folder
- fill the `Playlist` object with your desired:
    - _name_
    - _description_
    - _artists_
- if you want to update an existing playlist, also provide the __id_.

Then execute the new file as a script.
