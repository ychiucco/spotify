# Playlist

This module is used to create new playlists or update existing ones.

It needs the main `venv` active.

Copy `_blueprint.py` into a new file in this folder, fill the `Playlist` object
with the desired _artists_, _name_ and _description_ of the playlist, and remember to also give the __id_ if you want to update an existing playlist.

Then execute the new file as a script.
